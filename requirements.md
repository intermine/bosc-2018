# Handling integrated biological data using InterMine - Technical requirements

## Option 1 - install your own... 

### Python

_Compatability note: InterMine currently automatically generates Python 2.7 compliant code (3 is in the works!). For this reason we recommend python 2.7, although the client does support python 3._

- Python 2.7 (we'd recommend Anaconda for [Python 2.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux))
- The [InterMine python library](https://github.com/intermine/intermine-ws-python) [![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/intermine/badges/installer/conda.svg)](https://conda.anaconda.org/bioconda)
- Optional: [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html) - this isn't necessary if you installed Anaconda at the first step.

### R (optional)

- [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) (version 3.4.4)
- [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
- [InterMineR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/InterMineR.html), the InterMine R library.

The R demos will be presented via jupyter notebook + R so a local copy of R is not mandatory. 

## Option 2 - Fallback - Jupyter Notebooks + Binder

You can launch the python tutorials in a Jupyter notebook via [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs/master). Just click on the button below!
