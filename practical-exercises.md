# Practical exercises

## Getting started

1. The anatomy of a query script - step-by-step walkthrough of generated code. 
2. A longer use-case: [Finding genes that are upregulated in adipose tissue, interact with pparg, and are associated with Diabetes.](https://github.com/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs/blob/master/Workshop_Workflow1.ipynb)
3. Finding an InterMine with data that interests you! 
 

## Advanced things to try

These are optional challenges that can be attempted if you complete the tutorials ahead of everyone else! 

- Coax [disease expression data](https://github.com/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs/blob/master/Workshop_Workflow1.ipynb) into a pandas dataframe, and then into a bar chart that plots the expression?
